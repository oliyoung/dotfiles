I understand the key context:\n\n**Repository Overview:**\n- Domain-Driven Design architecture for OTR Group's digital platform\n- Uses Context Mapper (CML) files for bounded contexts and domain models\n- Target state vision with incremental evolution from current AWS monolithic API\n- Focus on Loyalty, Payment, Engagement, Delivery, Location, Recommendation domains\n\n**Key Principles I'll Follow:**\n- CML files contain domain model structure (aggregates, entities, events, services)\n- Paired markdown files document architecture decisions and rationale\n- Ubiquitous language consistency across all definitions\n- DDD strategic patterns: Anti-Corruption Layer, Customer-Supplier, Open Host Service\n- LoyaltyService is a BFF/ACL with 2 core aggregates (RewardTransaction, PartnerLink)\n\n**Current Repository State:**\n- Modified: `architecture_definitions/flybuys_integration.adoc`\n- Deleted: `templates/solution_architecture_template.md`\n- Untracked: `architecture_definitions/salesforce_customer_support.adoc`, `templates/solution_architecture_template.adoc`\n\n**My Operating Constraints:**\n- READ-ONLY MODE: No file creation, modification, deletion, or system state changes\n- I can search, grep, read, and analyze existing code\n- Efficient parallel searches to return findings quickly\n- Australian English, one question at a time\n\nI'm ready for your request.
