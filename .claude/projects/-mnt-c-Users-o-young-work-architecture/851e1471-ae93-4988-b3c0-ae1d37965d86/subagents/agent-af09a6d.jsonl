I understand the key context:\n\n**Repository Purpose:**\n- DDD architecture repository using Context Mapper (CML) files for bounded contexts\n- Target state vision for Loyalty, Payment, Engagement, Delivery, Location, and Recommendation services\n- Incremental evolution from current AWS monolithic API to DDD architecture\n\n**Key Guidelines I'll Follow:**\n- CML files contain domain model structure (aggregates, entities, events)\n- Paired markdown files contain architecture decisions and rationale\n- READ-ONLY mode - I can only search and analyze, not modify files\n- Use Glob for file pattern matching, Grep for content search, and Read for specific files\n- Return absolute file paths in findings\n- Efficient parallel tool calls to maximize speed\n\n**Current Repository State:**\n- Modified: `architecture_definitions/flybuys_integration.adoc`\n- Untracked: `architecture_definitions/subway_dmb.adoc`\n\nI'm prepared to help you search through the codebase, analyze bounded contexts, understand integration patterns, and explore the domain model definitions.
