incorporate these notes into this doc, but translate their "Phase 1" to be our TS-2, and their "Phase 2" to be our TS-3 REXP:                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  REXP manual feed is already in place and can be used by Flybuys to set up the automated ingestion and aim for March 31st.                                                                                      
  Because IDA was not done for manual ingestion, we will share the IDA for REXP data that we currently ingest manually. Oli to look through and approve the same.                                                
  Partner side changes - Change upload location and change cadence from weekly to daily. Oli confirmed the work effort on their side should be small and aligns with our dependency timeline. Also my team       
  called out that when creating a new sftp user for these new files' ingestion, we need you to create an ssh private key and share linked public key with us.

  Oli confirmed that they can control the shape of the data and will align OTR sales transaction & product hierarchy files to be same structure/attribute as REXP                                                
  Oli to provide a sample file with dummy data for us to do some discovery.                                                                                                                                      
  File with close to prod data will only be available post March production dates.
