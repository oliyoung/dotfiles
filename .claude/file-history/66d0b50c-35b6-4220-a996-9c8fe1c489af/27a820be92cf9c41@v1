== Why This Matters

=== Business Case

==== Customer Pain Points (Current State)

*REXP stores (OTR+ POS):*

* Manual Flybuys batch processing (Data Team exports CSV, uploads via SFTP)
* 24+ hour delay before points appear in Flybuys account
* High support burden: customers call when points missing
* No integration with OTR mobile app (REXP customers can't see Flybuys balance)
* No linking process (customers must remember Flybuys card number)

*OTR stores:*

* No Flybuys integration at all (OTR native rewards only)
* Lost opportunity with Flybuys-loyal customers
* Competitive disadvantage vs other fuel retailers

==== Strategic Objectives

[width="100%",cols="40%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Objective | How Flybuys Integration Delivers

|**Customer Lifetime Value**
|Flybuys members show 40% higher visit frequency (Coles partnership data)

|**Competitive Positioning**
|Match competitors (Shell Coles Express, 7-Eleven) offering Flybuys at fuel/convenience

|**Strategic Flexibility**
|Partner integration pattern enables future partners (Shell, airline programs) without architectural change

|**Operational Efficiency**
|Automated batch posting eliminates manual Data Team intervention (15 hours/month saved)

|**Revenue Protection**
|Dual-scheme tracking (Flybuys + Internal OTR shadow balance) enables future pivot to OTR-native rewards without losing transaction history
|===

|===

== Architecture Approach

=== Design Principles

[width="100%",cols="35%,65%",options="header",]
|===
|Principle | Application to Flybuys Integration

|**Vendor Independence**
|Anti-Corruption Layer pattern isolates domain from EagleEye and Flybuys API changes. Either platform swappable without mobile app changes.

|**Event-Driven Loose Coupling**
|ProfileService publishes `PartnerLinked` event; LoyaltyService and EngagementService consume independently. No direct service-to-service calls for notifications.

|**Single Source of Truth**
|ProfileService owns partner link status. LoyaltyService owns transaction adjudication audit trail. No data duplication.

|**Strategic Flexibility**
|Dual-scheme tracking (Flybuys + Internal OTR shadow balance) enables future pivot to OTR-native rewards without losing customer transaction history.

|**Customer-First APIs**
|Mobile app APIs designed for customer needs, not dictated by backend platform constraints. BFF pattern shields mobile from EagleEye complexity.
|===

=== Bounded Contexts Introduced

See xref:architecture-definitions:flybuys_integration.adoc[Architecture Definition] for complete bounded context documentation.

[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|Bounded Context | Role in Flybuys Integration

|xref:bounded-contexts:profile.adoc[**ProfileService**]
|OAuth partner linking, reward preference management, partner link status tracking. Acts as bridge between Salesforce canonical data and OTR-specific attributes.

|xref:bounded-contexts:loyalty.adoc[**LoyaltyService**]
|Transaction adjudication orchestration, Flybuys batch posting, loyalty credential resolution. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) abstracting EagleEye and Flybuys complexity from mobile app.

|xref:bounded-contexts:engagement.adoc[**EngagementService**]
|Campaign trigger routing (partner linked → "Flybuys linked successfully" email). Event-to-Braze translation for customer engagement.
|===

=== Key Capabilities Delivered

[width="100%",cols="30%,35%,35%",options="header",]
|===
|Capability | How It Works | Customer Value

|**Partner Account Linking**
|Mobile app OAuth 2.0 flow with Flybuys. ProfileService creates `PartnerLink` aggregate, publishes `PartnerLinked` event.
|Self-service, secure linking. No manual Flybuys card entry, no shared passwords.

|**Reward Preference Management**
|Customer selects: Flybuys Points, Fuel Discount (Shell), or OTR Rewards. ProfileService enforces "Flybuys Points requires linked account" invariant.
|Customer choice, flexibility. Can switch preference anytime without re-linking.

|**Real-Time Transaction Adjudication**
|POS calls LoyaltyService, which queries ProfileService for preference, EagleEye for campaigns. Response <500ms p95.
|Immediate feedback at POS. Receipt shows provisional points earned.

|**Automated Batch Posting**
|Daily batch job (01:00 UTC) generates CSV, PGP encrypts, transmits via SFTP to Flybuys. Retry logic on transmission failure.
|Points credited within 24 hours. Eliminates manual Data Team intervention.

|**Mobile Balance Visibility**
|Mobile app queries LoyaltyService, which queries Flybuys API via ACL. Response cached 5 minutes.
|Customer transparency. Check Flybuys balance without leaving OTR app.
|===

== Non-Functional Requirements Met

[width="100%",cols="35%,25%,40%",options="header",]
|===
|Requirement | Target | How We Meet It

|**Transaction Adjudication Latency**
|<500ms p95
|Async event processing, EagleEye ACL caching, ProfileService synchronous query optimized

|**OAuth Linking Success Rate**
|>95%
|User testing, clear error messaging, fallback to manual linking support

|**Batch File Transmission**
|99.9% success
|Retry logic (1-hour window), SFTP circuit breaker, automated alerting to operations team

|**Flybuys API Availability**
|99% uptime
|Circuit breaker pattern, cached balance (5-min TTL), graceful degradation to "balance unavailable"

|**PCI DSS Compliance**
|Level 1
|OAuth tokens in Azure Key Vault (AES-256), no payment card data in loyalty domain

|**Scalability**
|10,000 TPS peak
|Azure Functions autoscaling, Cosmos DB partition strategy (VivaConsumerId partition key)
|===

== Risks & Mitigation

[width="100%",cols="30%,35%,35%",options="header",]
|===
|Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy

|**Flybuys API Unavailability**
|Customer cannot link accounts, balance queries fail
|Circuit breaker pattern, cached balance (5-min TTL), fallback to "try again later" messaging. SLA monitoring with Flybuys.

|**OAuth Flow Complexity**
|Customers abandon linking (high drop-off rate)
|User testing with 50 customers pre-launch. Clear error messaging. Support article with screenshots. Fallback to phone support for complex cases.

|**Batch Transmission Failures**
|Points not credited to Flybuys, customer complaints
|Retry logic (5-min intervals for 1 hour). Automated alerting to operations team. Manual upload fallback if automated retry exhausted.

|**EagleEye API Changes**
|Transaction adjudication breaks, POS integration fails
|ACL pattern isolates domain from EagleEye. Comprehensive integration tests. EagleEye API versioning support. Change notification SLA with vendor.

|**Data Privacy Concerns**
|Customer reluctance to link accounts (trust issues)
|Clear consent screen in OAuth flow. Privacy policy update. FAQ: "Why is OTR asking for Flybuys login?" Customer support training.

|**POS Integration Complexity**
|D365 Commerce customization breaks existing POS functionality
|Bidirectional ACL prevents domain coupling. Feature flags enable instant rollback. Comprehensive POS regression testing. Pilot with 10 stores before rollout.
|===

== Key Decisions Made

See xref:architecture-definitions:flybuys_integration.adoc#key-architectural-patterns[Architecture Definition] for detailed rationale.

[width="100%",cols="35%,65%",options="header",]
|===
|Decision | Rationale

|**Flybuys uses Conformist pattern (no ACL)**
|Flybuys API is stable, mature, well-documented (OAuth 2.0 standard). Partnership time-bound (2-3 years). ACL overhead not justified. If API becomes unstable, ACL can be added later.

|**Dual-scheme tracking (Flybuys + Internal OTR)**
|Maintains internal OTR shadow balance independently of partner relationship. Enables future pivot to OTR-native rewards without losing transaction history. EagleEye hosts both schemes.

|**Two-phase transaction adjudication**
|Validation (pre-payment) shows provisional points. Redemption (post-payment) finalizes points after payment captured. Prevents fraud, handles payment method switching, ensures displayed points match earned points.

|**PartnerLink aggregate in ProfileService**
|Partner linking is customer profile data, not loyalty transaction data. Reduces LoyaltyService complexity to single aggregate (RewardTransaction). ProfileService natural home for customer relationships.

|**LoyaltyService as BFF/orchestrator**
|LoyaltyService doesn't own wallet, points, tiers, campaigns (EagleEye owns). Acts as facade, queries EagleEye in real-time. Simplicity over local caching. Event translation (EagleEye webhooks → OTR domain events).
|===

== Future Capacity Delivered

=== Reusable Patterns

* **Partner Integration Template:** OAuth linking, reward preference, batch posting reusable for Shell, airline programs, future partners
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Event Bus infrastructure supports AI-driven offers (2026 roadmap), real-time campaign management
* **BFF Pattern:** LoyaltyService facade enables mobile app evolution independent of backend platform changes

=== Platform Evolution

* **Subscription Integration:** SubscriptionService bounded context integrates with LoyaltyService for tier benefits (e.g., "Premium members earn 2X points")
* **AI-Driven Offers:** RecommendationService consumes loyalty events for next-best-offer predictions (2026 capability)
* **Multi-Partner Wallet:** Customer can link multiple partners (Flybuys, Shell, airline), select preference per transaction (advanced feature)

=== Organizational Capability

* **DDD Architecture Maturity:** First DDD bounded contexts (Profile, Loyalty, Engagement) establish patterns for future services
* **Vendor Independence:** ACL pattern and BFF architecture reduce vendor lock-in risk (EagleEye swappable without mobile app rewrite)
* **Scalable Event Platform:** Event Bus supports future real-time analytics, fraud detection, personalization engines
