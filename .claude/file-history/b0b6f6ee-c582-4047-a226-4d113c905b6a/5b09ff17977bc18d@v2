:description: Bounded Context for the Loyalty Domain
:keywords: loyalty, bounded context, togaf, ddd


Core service for loyalty programme management across all OTRG brands
(OTRG[OTRG], link:Reddy%2520Express%2520%28REXP[Reddy
Express (REXP)].md), Liberty[Liberty] and
Dealer Operated[Dealer Operated] sites). This
service orchestrates loyalty operations, integrates with external
loyalty platforms
(link:external/eagle_eye.adoc[EagleEye],
link:external/flybuys.adoc[Flybuys]), and publishes
domain events to downstream services.

== Business Context

The `LoyaltyService` is a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) orchestration layer that manages customer loyalty programme interactions across the OTRG portfolio (OTR, Reddy Express, and dealer-operated sites).

It enables customers to earn rewards on purchases, redeem benefits, and participate in coalition loyalty programmes (Flybuys) while providing the business with vendor independence, flexible programme configuration, and real-time loyalty economics visibility.

== Architectural Pattern

The `LoyaltyService` acts as an orchestrator and translator, NOT a system of record.

It protects OTR's domain model from external loyalty platforms through Anti-Corruption Layers (ACL) and publishes domain events in OTR's ubiquitous language.

== Strategic Value

=== Vendor Independence
- ACL pattern protects domain from loyalty platform vendor lock-in
- EagleEye is swappable without rewriting mobile app or domain logic
- Single orchestration layer shields business from platform migrations

=== Customer Lifetime Value

Loyalty members show significantly higher lifetime value vs non-members through:

- Increased visit frequency via points earning and tier benefits
- Larger basket size through targeted offers and cross-sell incentives
- Reduced churn through stored value lock-in and subscription programmes

=== Revenue Protection

Stored value programmes create cash flow benefit and reduce customer churn

=== Competitive Positioning

Flybuys integration provides access to 8M+ coalition members via partner API

=== Margin Optimisation

Orchestrated offer targeting drives high-margin product sales

=== Platform Efficiency

Single BFF serves multiple brands (OTR, REXP, dealer sites), reducing operational cost

== Long-Term Vision

The LoyaltyService is a Core Domain microservice that forms a cornerstone of the OTRG Digital capability:

- Vendor-agnostic loyalty orchestration - OTR controls the customer experience, not defined by third-party platforms
- OTR-owned customer wallet abstraction - Customers have their own wallet view regardless of backend provider
- Flybuys repositioned as third-party partner, not primary loyalty platform, supporting future partners beyond Flybuys
- Migration path for existing programmes - OTR reward programmes (coffee redemption, car wash, Subway, fuel discounts) will migrate to unified loyalty platform
- Event-driven architecture - LoyaltyService paired with EngagementService, ProfileService, and RecommendationService
- 2026 roadmap capabilities: AI-driven offers, real-time campaign management, sophisticated segmentation

== Future State Benefits
- Vendor independence - Swap EagleEye for alternative loyalty platforms without domain changes
- Single loyalty orchestration layer for all campaigns, users, channels, and platforms
- Advanced features: Flybuys integration, subscriptions, member referrals, gifting
- Unified customer view across all channels via event-driven integration
- Real-time transaction adjudication with offer stacking and complex eligibility rules
- Scalable BFF architecture supporting 2026 Digital Roadmap growth

== Infrastructure Abstractions

Following xref:patterns:clean_architecture.adoc[Clean Architecture] principles, LoyaltyService depends on **abstractions** (ports), not concrete implementations.

See: xref:../application-layer/loyalty/use-cases.adoc[Application Layer Use Cases] for detailed port definitions.

=== Application Ports (Interfaces)

==== Data Access Ports

[source,csharp]
----
// IRewardTransactionRepository - Persistence for RewardTransaction aggregate
public interface IRewardTransactionRepository
{
    Task Save(RewardTransaction transaction);
    Task<RewardTransaction> FindById(TransactionId id);
    Task<List<RewardTransaction>> FindByCustomerId(CustomerId customerId, int limit);
    Task<List<RewardTransaction>> FindByDateRange(DateTime from, DateTime to);
}

// Note: No repositories for Wallet, Points Ledger, Membership, Campaigns
// These are queried in real-time from EagleEye via ILoyaltyPlatformPort
----

==== External System Ports (ACL Abstractions)

[source,csharp]
----
// ILoyaltyPlatformPort - EagleEye abstraction
public interface ILoyaltyPlatformPort
{
    Task<AdjudicationResult> AdjudicateTransaction(AdjudicationRequest request);
    Task<PointsBalance> GetPointsBalance(CustomerId customerId, LoyaltyScheme scheme);
    Task<Wallet> GetWallet(CustomerId customerId);
    Task<List<Campaign>> GetActiveCampaigns(CustomerId customerId);
}

// IProfileServicePort - ProfileService abstraction (another bounded context)
public interface IProfileServicePort
{
    Task<CustomerContext> GetCustomerContext(CustomerId customerId);
    Task<List<PartnerLink>> GetPartnerLinks(CustomerId customerId);
}

// IPartnerPlatformPort - Flybuys/Shell abstraction
public interface IPartnerPlatformPort
{
    Task<string> GetMemberId(string accessToken);
    Task ActivateAccount(string memberId, ActivationRequest request);
    Task<PartnerBalance> GetBalance(string memberId);
}
----

==== Infrastructure Service Ports

[source,csharp]
----
// IEventBusPort - Event publishing abstraction
public interface IEventBusPort
{
    Task Publish<TEvent>(TEvent domainEvent) where TEvent : IDomainEvent;
}

// ICachePort - Caching abstraction (for points balance queries)
public interface ICachePort
{
    Task<T> Get<T>(string key);
    Task Set<T>(string key, T value, TimeSpan ttl);
}

// IObservabilityPort - Monitoring/logging abstraction
public interface IObservabilityPort
{
    void LogInformation(string message, params object[] args);
    void LogError(Exception ex, string message, params object[] args);
    void RecordMetric(string metricName, double value);
}
----

=== Concrete Implementations (Infrastructure Layer)

**Note**: Concrete implementations documented in deployment architecture, not domain architecture.

See: `infrastructure/loyalty-infrastructure.adoc` for:

* Database implementation (NoSQL document store for RewardTransaction)
* EagleEye adapter (ACL translating EagleEye API → OTR domain model)
* Flybuys adapter (ACL for coalition partner integration)
* ProfileService client (inter-service communication)
* Event bus implementation (EventBridge/Kinesis)
* Cache implementation (Redis for points balance)
* Observability implementation (CloudWatch/Application Insights)
* PartnerLink (moved to ProfileService)

== Architecture Decisions

=== Dual-Scheme Points Tracking (Flybuys + Internal OTR Shadow Balance)

==== Decision

LoyaltyService tracks multiple loyalty schemes in parallel - Flybuys partner points AND an internal OTR shadow points balance. Both schemes are configured in EagleEye and updated atomically during transaction adjudication.

==== Rationale

* *Strategic Flexibility*: Maintains internal points balance independently of partner relationship duration
* *System of Record*: EagleEye hosts BOTH schemes - LoyaltyService remains BFF/orchestrator, not system of record
* *Simplicity*: All-or-nothing posting to both schemes (no complex partial failure handling needed now)
* *Audit Trail*: RewardTransaction tracks which schemes participated for debugging and reconciliation
* *Future Activation*: Internal scheme dormant now, but infrastructure ready for product activation

==== Implementation

* *EagleEye Configuration*: Two schemes per customer:
** FLYBUYS: Partner points scheme (transmitted to Flybuys via daily batch)
** INTERNAL_OTR: Internal OTR points scheme (dormant, not customer-visible)
* *RewardTransaction Aggregate*: `schemesParticipated` field tracks which schemes were posted to
* *Domain Events*: `PointsEarned`, `PointsRedeemed`, `PointsExpired`, `PointsAdjusted` include `scheme` context
* *Query Layer Separation*:
** `getCustomerVisibleBalance()`: Returns Flybuys only (current product)
** `getAllSchemeBalances()`: Returns both schemes (analytics, backoffice)
** `getPointsBalance(scheme)`: Returns specific scheme balance
* *Adjudication*: Single EagleEye API call updates both schemes atomically

==== TOGAF Alignment

* *Business Architecture*: Supports reward preference flexibility and partner independence strategy
* *Data Architecture*: EagleEye remains authoritative system of record for all points data
* *Application Architecture*: LoyaltyService BFF pattern maintained - no new aggregates needed
* *Technology Architecture*: Leverages existing EagleEye multi-scheme capability (no new infrastructure)

==== Future

* Internal scheme activation: Change `getCustomerVisibleBalance()` to return INTERNAL_OTR instead of FLYBUYS
* Independent failure handling: Extend RewardTransaction to track per-scheme status if business rules diverge
* Customer choice: Add reward preference UI to select visible scheme (Flybuys vs OTR points)

=== Transaction Transactions Don't Belong in LoyaltyService

==== Decision

LoyaltyService stores transaction summaries, not full transaction details.

==== Rationale

* D365 Commerce Context owns transaction details (transaction, line items, receipt)
* LoyaltyService only needs summary for reward history display
* Storing transactions would duplicate POS data
* Bounded context boundary: ``what was purchased`` vs ``what rewards were earned``

==== Implementation

* RewardTransaction aggregate stores itemCount and itemSummary for display
* Example: "_2 items - Fuel, Coffee_" instead of full product details
* Reference to POS transaction via sourceTransactionId for full details

=== OAuth Tokens Managed by Infrastructure Service

==== Decision

OAuth token management is handled by a generic infrastructure OAuth Service, not within LoyaltyService domain.

==== Rationale

* OAuth token life-cycle is infrastructure concern, not domain logic
* Generic OAuth Service can be used by ANY OTR system (not just loyalty)
* PartnerLink aggregate only tracks business fact: ``customer linked partner''
* OAuth Service handles: token storage, refresh, revocation

==== Implementation
* PartnerLink aggregate contains oauthProviderId reference to OAuth Service
* OAuth Service handles entire OAuth flow, notifies LoyaltyService when complete
* LoyaltyService creates PartnerLink in response to OAuthLinkEstablished event
* Domain focuses on linking status, infrastructure handles tokens

=== Wallet Subdomain Owned by EagleEye

==== Decision

Wallet data (grants, fuel discounts, product offers) is owned by EagleEye, queried in real-time.

==== Rationale

* EagleEye AIR platform is system of record for wallet contents
* Storing wallet locally would create sync issues
* Wallet grants are loyalty platform feature (EagleEye's core capability)
* LoyaltyService acts as facade/BFF, not system of record

==== Implementation

* LoyaltyService queries EagleEye API via ACL when displaying wallet
* No local wallet storage - always query fresh data
* GrantIssued, GrantRedeemed events published based on EagleEye webhooks
* ACL translates EagleEye wallet model to OTR domain language

=== Points Subdomain Owned by EagleEye

==== Decision

Points balance and ledger are owned by EagleEye, queried in real-time.

==== Rationale

* EagleEye manages points balance across multiple programs/schemes
* Points calculation rules defined in EagleEye
* EagleEye provides ``Account Transactions'' (ledger)
* Maintaining separate ledger would cause sync issues

==== Implementation
* LoyaltyService queries EagleEye API via ACL for balance display
* No local ledger storage - EagleEye is source of truth
* PointsEarned, PointsRedeemed, PointsExpired events published based on EagleEye webhooks
* ACL translates EagleEye account transactions to OTR domain events

=== Membership Subdomain Owned by EagleEye

==== Decision

Membership enrollment, tiers, and progression are owned by EagleEye.

==== Rationale

* EagleEye ``Schemes'' define tier structures and progression rules
* Tier benefits and progression logic configured in EagleEye
* Multiple loyalty programs managed by EagleEye
* LoyaltyService queries tier status, doesn't manage it

==== Implementation
* LoyaltyService queries EagleEye for current tier via ACL
* ACL translates EagleEye scheme/tier model to OTR domain language
* Minor exception: Simple Member record created on-demand for transaction adjudication (defensive upsert)

=== Campaigns Subdomain Owned by EagleEye

==== Decision

Campaign management and promotional rules are owned by EagleEye.

==== Rationale

* EagleEye ``Campaigns'' define reward rules and eligibility criteria
* Marketing team configures campaigns in EagleEye dashboard
* Campaign execution happens in EagleEye during adjudication
* Promotional logic owned by loyalty platform

==== Implementation

* LoyaltyService queries active campaigns from EagleEye via ACL
* Campaign eligibility evaluated by EagleEye during transaction adjudication
* CampaignActivated event published based on EagleEye webhooks (if needed)
* ACL translates EagleEye campaign model to OTR domain language

=== Subscriptions Owned by Separate Bounded Context

==== Decision

Subscription management belongs in a separate SubscriptionService bounded context, not in LoyaltyService.

==== Rationale

* Subscription management is distinct business capability
* Integrates with payment gateway for recurring billing (note: this will NOT be DataMesh - this is not one of their product offerings)
* Subscription life-cycle independent from loyalty rewards
* Clear bounded context boundary: billing vs. rewards

==== Implementation
* SubscriptionService bounded context owns subscription plans, billing, payment coordination
* LoyaltyService subscribes to subscription life-cycle events
* Subscription benefits reflected in EagleEye tier/scheme configuration
* Event-driven integration between SubscriptionService and LoyaltyService

=== LoyaltyService as Event Publisher for EagleEye

==== Decision

LoyaltyService translates EagleEye webhooks into OTR domain events.

==== Rationale

* Third-party platforms (EagleEye, Braze) don't publish to OTR's Event Hub
* LoyaltyService receives EagleEye webhooks → ACL translates → publishes events
* Provides clean domain events in OTR's ubiquitous language
* Other bounded contexts consume events without knowing about EagleEye

==== Implementation
* EagleEye webhooks endpoint in LoyaltyService
* ACL translates webhook payloads to domain events
* Events like PointsEarned, GrantIssued published by LoyaltyService
* Event schemas reflect OTR domain model, not EagleEye's model
* Documentation clarifies event sources (aggregate changes vs. webhook translations)

=== Two-Phase transaction adjudication (Validation + Redemption)

==== Decision

LoyaltyService implements two-phase commit pattern for reward transactions: Validation (pre-payment) and Redemption (post-payment).

==== Rationale

* Customers need to see provisional rewards BEFORE paying (validation phase)
* Payment method affects reward eligibility and point calculations
* Only finalise rewards AFTER payment captured (prevent fraud, handle failed payments)
* Two phases ensure consistency between displayed rewards and actual rewards earned
* Guards against payment method switching (validate with selected method, redeem with actual method)

==== Payment Method Awareness

Different payment methods have different eligibility rules and earning rates:

* *Promotional Grants/Discounts*: Payment methods with active grants may exclude points on grant amounts
** Example: Shell Card with 8CPL/4CPL docket deals - NO points on grant amounts, base points on net paid
* *Co-branded Payment Methods*: May have partner-specific bonus earning rates or restrictions
** Example: Future Flybuys credit card might earn 2X points vs standard 1X
* *Digital Wallets*: May have different eligibility than physical cards
** Example: Apple Pay/Google Pay treated as standard credit card for
eligibility
* *BNPL/Gift Cards*: May have restricted eligibility or different earning rates
** Example: Gift card purchases might not earn loyalty points
* Payment method metadata includes: type, active grants/discounts, eligibility flags
* Payment method must be provided in validation phase to calculate correct provisional points
* Re-validation in redemption phase ensures consistency with actual payment method used

==== Implementation

===== Phase 1 (Validation)

D365Commerce → `LoyaltyService.validateTransaction(transaction, paymentMethod)`

* Applies payment-method-specific eligibility rules
* Returns provisional points/rewards customer will earn
* Displayed on payment screen before customer pays
* NO aggregate created (provisional calculation only)

===== Phase 2 (Redemption)

D365Commerce → `LoyaltyService.redeemTransaction(transactionId, paymentConfirmation)`

* Payment successfully captured
* Re-validates with actual payment method used (consistency check)
* Creates RewardTransaction aggregate with finalised points and payment method metadata
* Queues for daily batch posting to loyalty partners
* Publishes TransactionAdjudicated domain event

*RewardTransaction aggregate stores paymentMethod for:*

* Audit trail (what payment method was used)
* Reconciliation (verify points calculated correctly)
* Analytics (payment method preferences, grant usage)
* Partner reporting (batch file generation may need payment method context)

*Why This Matters:*

* Different payment methods represent different customer value propositions
* Promotional grants affect partnership economics (e.g., Flybuys points eligibility)
* Incorrect point calculations could lead to partnership disputes or customer dissatisfaction
* Two-phase pattern provides clear separation: ``what customer will earn'' vs ``what customer earned''
* Extensible to future payment types without architectural changes

== Patterns

=== Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)

* EagleEye ACL: Translates between EagleEye's domain model and LoyaltyService domain
* Protects domain from external API changes
* Single place to update when EagleEye changes

=== Event-Driven Integration

* LoyaltyService publishes domain events to Event Bus
* Other contexts (EngagementService, RecommendationService) consume events
* Loose coupling, temporal decoupling, scalability

=== Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)

* LoyaltyService acts as facade for mobile app
* Aggregates data from multiple sources (EagleEye, CRM, etc.)
* Provides clean API in OTR's domain language

=== Query-Only for External Data

* Wallet, points, tiers queried in real-time from EagleEye
* No local caching/replication (simplicity over performance)
* EagleEye is single source of truth

=== Defensive Programming

* Auto-create member records if missing (data sync resilience)
* Graceful degradation when EagleEye unavailable
* Publish monitoring events for unusual occurrences

=== DDD Principles Applied

==== Bounded Context Boundaries

===== Don`t duplicate data across contexts

* Transaction transactions → POS owns
* Customer preferences → CRM owns
* Loyalty balances → EagleEye owns

===== Store only what you need

* Transaction summary, not full transaction
* Link status, not OAuth tokens
* Adjudication result, not calculation logic

===== Use references, not copies

* sourceTransactionId → POS transaction
* oauthProviderId → OAuth Service token
* externalMemberId → Partner account

===== Identify true system of record

* Points balance → EagleEye (they calculate it)
* Tier levels → EagleEye (they manage progression)
* Wallet grants → EagleEye (they issue them)

===== Infrastructure vs. Domain

* OAuth tokens → Infrastructure
* Linking status → Domain
* API calls → Infrastructure
* Business rules → Domain
