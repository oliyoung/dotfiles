:description: Bounded Context for the Product Domain - Product catalog and pricing facade
:keywords: product, catalog, pricing, bounded context, togaf, ddd, facade, acl

Product catalog and pricing facade service that translates D365 Commerce product and pricing data into AWS-native APIs for customer-facing applications and external integrations.

This service acts as an Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) between back-office systems (Azure) and ecommerce domain (AWS), providing a stable, domain-aligned API contract for digital menu boards, mobile apps, and ecommerce platforms.

== Business Context

The `ProductCatalogService` is a facade and translation layer that bridges OTR's back-office product and pricing systems (D365 Commerce on Azure) with customer-facing digital experiences (AWS).

It enables external systems (Amped Digital DMB, OTR Mobile App, SMGB Online) to consume product catalog and pricing data through a standardised REST API without coupling to D365's domain model or Azure infrastructure.

Initial use case: Subway Digital Menu Board pricing integration with Amped Digital vendor.

== Architectural Pattern

The `ProductCatalogService` acts as a **Facade and Anti-Corruption Layer**, NOT a system of record.

It protects the ecommerce domain from D365 Commerce's data model and provides a stable API contract in OTR's ubiquitous language, enabling back-office systems to evolve independently.

=== Key Characteristics

* **Facade Layer:** Simplifies access to complex back-office pricing data
* **Anti-Corruption Layer:** Translates D365 terminology into domain language
* **Caching Layer:** Stores pricing data locally for fast query performance
* **Event Publisher:** Publishes domain events when pricing changes (future-proofing)

== Strategic Value

=== Vendor Independence

* ACL pattern protects ecommerce domain from D365 Commerce data model changes
* D365 can be replaced with alternative ERP/product systems without rewriting consumers
* Single translation layer shields digital experiences from back-office migrations

=== Platform Consistency

* All customer-facing pricing APIs hosted on AWS (ecommerce team's platform)
* Consistent with OTR Mobile App, SMGB Online, and digital experiences architecture
* Leverages existing AWS expertise, tooling, and operational processes

=== Operational Efficiency

* Single API serves multiple consumers (DMB, mobile, web, future integrations)
* Reduces point-to-point integrations between D365 and customer-facing systems
* Centralised caching reduces load on D365 Commerce API

=== Future Extensibility

* Event-driven integration enables reactive pricing updates across ecosystem
* Foundation for advanced features: price testing, dynamic pricing, promotional rules
* Scalable pattern for additional product catalog capabilities (inventory, categories)

== Long-Term Vision

The ProductCatalogService is a **Supporting Domain** microservice that forms part of OTRG's ecommerce platform:

* **Cross-cloud integration pattern:** Clean data contract between Azure (back-office) and AWS (ecommerce)
* **Multi-brand support:** Single service supports OTR, Subway, SMGB, and future brands
* **API-first design:** RESTful API with OpenAPI specification for external vendors
* **Event-driven future:** Enables real-time price change notifications to mobile apps, DMBs, and web platforms
* **2026 roadmap capabilities:** Dynamic pricing, A/B price testing, promotional pricing engine integration

== Future State Benefits

* **Vendor independence:** Swap D365 Commerce for alternative product/pricing systems without domain changes
* **Single pricing API** for all customer-facing channels (DMB, mobile, web, kiosks)
* **Advanced features:** Real-time price updates via events, promotional pricing integration, inventory visibility
* **Unified product catalog** across all OTR brands and channels
* **Scalable architecture:** Supporting 2026 Digital Roadmap growth and multi-brand expansion

== Aggregates

[width="100%",cols="15%,85%",options="header",]
|===
|Aggregate Name |Description

|`ProductPrice`
|Cached representation of product pricing from D365 Commerce. Contains product details (ID, name, category), price groups, regional pricing, and store assignments. Updated hourly via ETL pipeline. **Not** a system of record - D365 Commerce owns authoritative pricing data.

|===

=== Aggregate: ProductPrice

The `ProductPrice` aggregate represents a cached view of pricing data for external API consumption.

*Aggregate Root:* `Product`

*Entities:*

* `Product` - Product identifier, name, category (aggregate root)
* `Price` - Price amount, price group, effective dates
* `PriceGroup` - Price group identifier, region code, store assignments

*Invariants:*

* Price amount must be greater than zero
* Each product must have at least one price group
* Effective date ranges cannot overlap for the same product/price group combination
* Store IDs must exist in the store master data

*Lifecycle:*

. Created/updated via hourly ETL pipeline from D365 Commerce export
. Validated against data contract schema
. Stored in RDS PostgreSQL for fast query access
. Queried via REST API by external consumers
. Refreshed hourly - data is eventually consistent (max 1 hour lag)

== Services

=== Future Event Consumers

Potential downstream consumers for pricing change events:

* **link:location.adoc[LocationService]:** Update store-specific pricing for store finder
* **link:interfaces/mobile.adoc[MobileApp]:** Invalidate cached prices, show "price updated" notifications
* **link:engagement.adoc[EngagementService]:** Trigger "price drop" campaigns for customer engagement
* **Data Platform:** Analytics and reporting on pricing changes

== Integration Patterns

=== Upstream: D365 Commerce → ProductCatalogService

**Pattern:** Customer-Supplier + Conformist

* **D365 Commerce (Supplier):** Exports pricing data to S3 on hourly schedule
* **ProductCatalogService (Customer):** Conforms to D365's data contract and schema
* **Integration Technology:** S3 bucket with cross-account IAM access (Azure → AWS)
* **Data Format:** Apache Parquet files with defined schema
* **Update Frequency:** Hourly batch export
* **Anti-Corruption Layer:** D365PricingTranslator translates D365 terminology into domain language

=== Downstream: ProductCatalogService → External Consumers

**Pattern:** Open Host Service + Published Language

* **ProductCatalogService (Open Host):** Publishes stable REST API contract
* **External Consumers (Amped Digital, future mobile/web):** Consume API without translation
* **Integration Technology:** REST API via API Gateway, OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials authentication
* **Data Format:** JSON with OpenAPI specification
* **Update Frequency:** Real-time queries (data eventually consistent, max 1 hour lag)
* **Published Language:** OTR domain terminology (product, price, store, price group)

=== Cross-Cloud Integration

**Pattern:** Domain Boundary via S3 Data Contract

* **Back-Office Domain (Azure):** D365 Commerce, Azure Data Lake, Microsoft Fabric
* **Ecommerce Domain (AWS):** S3, Glue/Lambda, RDS, API Gateway, ECS
* **Domain Interface:** S3 bucket with data contract (schema, SLA, quality rules)
* **Rationale:** Clean separation between domains; each uses native cloud services

== Technology Stack

=== AWS Services

* **S3:** Data handoff point (cross-cloud transfer from Azure)
* **AWS Glue / Lambda:** ETL pipeline for data ingestion and validation
* **RDS PostgreSQL:** Queryable pricing database
* **API Gateway:** REST API endpoint with OAuth 2.0 authentication
* **ECS Fargate:** API service containers
* **CloudWatch:** Monitoring, logging, alerting
* **Secrets Manager:** OAuth client credentials storage
* **WAF:** API security and rate limiting

== Architecture Decisions

=== ADR-001: ProductCatalogService as Facade, Not System of Record

* **Context:** Need to expose D365 Commerce pricing to external systems
* **Decision:** ProductCatalogService is a facade/ACL, not authoritative source
* **Rationale:** D365 Commerce owns pricing rules and configuration; duplicating logic would create consistency issues
* **Consequences:** Service is eventually consistent (max 1 hour lag); D365 remains source of truth
* **Status:** Approved

=== ADR-002: Cross-Cloud Integration via S3 Data Contract

* **Context:** D365 Commerce on Azure, ProductCatalogService on AWS
* **Decision:** S3 bucket with data contract as domain boundary
* **Rationale:** Clean separation; each domain uses native cloud services; loose coupling
* **Consequences:** Cross-cloud data transfer required; need cross-account IAM setup
* **Status:** Approved

=== ADR-003: Hourly Batch ETL vs Real-Time Streaming

* **Context:** Pricing data needs to flow from D365 to ProductCatalogService
* **Decision:** Hourly batch export, not real-time CDC (Change Data Capture)
* **Rationale:** Prices change infrequently; batch simpler than CDC; 1-hour lag acceptable per requirements
* **Consequences:** Data eventually consistent; not suitable for high-frequency price changes
* **Status:** Approved

=== ADR-004: RDS PostgreSQL vs DynamoDB

* **Context:** Need queryable store for pricing data
* **Decision:** RDS PostgreSQL over DynamoDB
* **Rationale:** Relational model fits pricing domain (products → prices → stores); team expertise; SQL queries
* **Consequences:** Need to manage schema migrations; vertical scaling limitations
* **Status:** Approved

=== ADR-005: Event Publishing for Future Extensibility

* **Context:** Future consumers may need real-time pricing change notifications
* **Decision:** Design event schema now, publish events, even if no initial consumers
* **Rationale:** Enables future event-driven architecture without service redesign; low implementation cost
* **Consequences:** Need to maintain event schema stability; unused events initially
* **Status:** Approved

== API Contract

=== REST API Endpoints

**Base URL:** `https://api.otr.com.au/product-catalog/v1`

**Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow

==== GET /pricing
