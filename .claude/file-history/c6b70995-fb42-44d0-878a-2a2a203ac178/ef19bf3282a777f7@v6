== Purpose and Scope

=== Purpose

This Solution Architecture defines how the Salesforce Customer Support consolidation will be implemented - the specific technology products, configurations, interfaces, and deployment architecture that realise the xref:../architecture_definitions/salesforce_customer_support.adoc[Salesforce Customer Support Architecture Definition].

This solution establishes the **first implementation of OTR's target Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture** by deploying two new bounded contexts (ProfileService and EngagementService) as microservices, consolidating customer support onto Salesforce Service Cloud, and implementing event-driven integration patterns that will serve as the foundation for future bounded contexts (including Flybuys integration).

=== Vision

> Unify customer support across all OTRG channels by consolidating OTR digital customer feedback onto Salesforce Service Cloud, establishing the foundational DDD architecture with ProfileService and EngagementService bounded contexts that protect digital channels from external system changes while enabling support agents to deliver exceptional customer experiences with complete interaction history.

=== Architectural Approach

This architecture establishes OTR's **first bounded context implementation** using Domain-Driven Design strategic patterns:

* *link:../bounded_context/profile.adoc[ProfileService]* (NEW bounded context): Just-In-Time Contact reconciliation with Salesforce, upsert by email, returns Salesforce Contact ID to digital channels - foundation for future Flybuys partner linking
* *link:../bounded_context/engagement.adoc[EngagementService]* (NEW bounded context): Customer feedback submission facade, Anti-Corruption Layer for Salesforce Case creation, Braze integration for push notifications, async Case processing via Event Bus
* *Event-driven integration* (NEW pattern): Domain event publishing using existing AWS infrastructure (SNS+SQS/EventBridge/Kinesis) - first implementation establishing pattern for future bounded contexts
* *Anti-Corruption Layer*: EngagementService isolates digital channels from Salesforce API changes, translates between OTR domain language and Salesforce Service Cloud API
* *Conformist Pattern*: ProfileService and EngagementService conform to existing Salesforce configuration (shared Viva Energy instance, multi-tenant governance)
* *Big bang cutover*: Single deployment after Contact migration, no phased rollout, D365 CE retirement post-cutover

==== Key Architectural Patterns

[width="100%",cols="25%,35%,40%",options="header",]
|===
|Pattern |Application |Rationale

|*Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)*
|EngagementService → Salesforce Service Cloud
|Protects digital channels (Mobile App, Web) from Salesforce API changes, translates between OTR domain language and Salesforce Case/Contact model, enables independent evolution of internal domain model

|*Conformist*
|ProfileService → Salesforce, EngagementService → Salesforce
|Shared Viva Energy Salesforce instance - we conform to existing configuration, governance, and API contracts (external system we don't control)

|*Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)*
|EngagementService
|Aggregates customer feedback submission, Contact lookup, async Case creation, and Braze notification orchestration for digital channel clients

|*Event-Driven Architecture (OHS+PL)*
|Event Bus (SNS+SQS/EventBridge/Kinesis)
|Loose coupling between bounded contexts, async domain event publishing (`SupportCaseCreated`, `SupportCaseUpdated`, `CustomerFeedbackSubmitted`), foundation for future bounded contexts

|*Just-In-Time (JIT) Integration*
|ProfileService → Salesforce Contact reconciliation
|Reconcile app users as Salesforce Contacts on-demand (upsert by email), no pre-sync required, ensures Salesforce has current Contact data

|*Async Processing*
|EngagementService Case creation via Event Bus
|Non-blocking user experience, resilience to Salesforce downtime, automatic retry with exponential backoff, dead letter queue for operations team intervention

|*Strangler Fig*
|Not applicable
|Big bang cutover (no gradual migration) - D365 CE fully replaced, not incrementally strangled

|===

<<<
== Solution Approach

* Deploy xref:../bounded_context/profile.adoc[ProfileService] and xref:../bounded_context/engagement.adoc[EngagementService] as bounded context microservices
* Implement Anti-Corruption Layers (ACLs) for Salesforce and Braze integration
* Establish event-driven architecture as the foundational integration pattern
* Big bang cutover (TS-1 → TS-4)

<<<
== Executive Summary

=== Challenge

OTR digital customers (Mobile App, Web) currently submit feedback and support requests to D365 Customer Engagement, while Viva Energy's broader business units (fuel wholesale, Shell Card customers, other retail channels) use Salesforce Service Cloud. This creates:

* *Fragmented customer support platform*: Customer support data split across two systems, preventing support agents from having a unified view of customer interactions across all channels
* *Operational inefficiency*: Maintaining two separate customer support platforms increases operational overhead and costs
* *Poor support experience*: D365 CE is not working well for digital customer support, impacting customer satisfaction and case resolution times
* *Post-merger consolidation opportunity*: Following Viva Energy's acquisition of OTR, strategic alignment on Salesforce as the enterprise customer support platform

=== Solution

This architecture establishes the **foundational Domain-Driven Design (DDD) implementation** for OTR's target state architecture by introducing two new bounded contexts (link:../bounded_context/profile.adoc[ProfileService], link:../bounded_context/engagement.adoc[EngagementService]) and event-driven integration patterns:

==== New Bounded Contexts

* *link:../bounded_context/profile.adoc[ProfileService]* (NEW): Just-In-Time (JIT) Contact reconciliation with Salesforce, upsert by email, returns Salesforce Contact ID to Mobile App
* *link:../bounded_context/engagement.adoc[EngagementService]* (NEW): Customer feedback submission, Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) for Salesforce Case creation, Braze integration for customer notifications, async Case processing via Event Bus
* *Event Bus* (NEW pattern): Domain event publishing using existing AWS infrastructure (SNS+SQS/EventBridge/Kinesis) - first implementation of event-driven architecture pattern

==== Integration Architecture

* *Salesforce = System of Record*: Salesforce Service Cloud (shared Viva Energy instance) owns Contact and Case data
* *Conformist Pattern*: ProfileService and EngagementService conform to existing Salesforce configuration and API contracts
* *Anti-Corruption Layer*: EngagementService protects digital channels from Salesforce API changes, translates between OTR domain language and Salesforce
* *Async Case Creation*: Non-blocking user experience, resilience to Salesforce downtime, automatic retry with exponential backoff, dead letter queue for failed Cases
* *Event-Driven Notifications*: Salesforce webhook → EngagementService → Braze push notifications for Case status updates

==== Migration Approach

* *Contact Migration*: One-time migration from app-specific database → Salesforce (upsert with flexible matching by email/phone/VCI)
* *No Case Migration*: Historical D365 CE Cases not migrated (fresh start in Salesforce)
* *Big Bang Cutover*: Single deployment, no phased rollout or parallel run
* *D365 CE Retirement*: Complete decommissioning of D365 Customer Engagement post-cutover

=== Key Architectural Significance

This migration establishes the first implementation of OTR's target DDD architecture:

* First bounded contexts implemented (ProfileService, EngagementService)
* First event-driven domain event pattern (foundation for future bounded contexts)
* Foundation for Flybuys integration (ProfileService Contact reconciliation reused)
* Establishes integration patterns (Conformist, ACL, Event-Driven) for future services

=== Success Criteria

* All digital customer feedback routed to Salesforce Service Cloud within 30 days of launch
* Support agents have unified customer view across all Viva Energy channels (digital, wholesale, Shell Card, other retail)
* D365 Customer Engagement decommissioned within 90 days post-cutover
* Customer satisfaction score improves by 15% within 6 months
* Average case resolution time decreases by 20% within 6 months
* Zero data loss during Contact migration (100% validation pass rate)
* Mobile App feedback submission success rate > 99.5% (including async Case creation)

=== Technical Constraints

* Shared Salesforce instance (Viva Energy multi-tenant environment)
* Conform to existing Salesforce configuration and governance (data isolation strategy TBD with Salesforce admin team)
* Contact migration must complete before cutover (no parallel run)
* Async Case creation mandatory (non-blocking user experience)
* Expected volume: 100-150 feedback submissions/day from 20k DAU (~0.5-0.75% submission rate), architecture capacity planned for 3x-10x growth

=== Open Technical Decisions (TBD)

* Salesforce Case field mapping for digital feedback categories (App, Service, Order, Rewards, Refund, Delete Account)
* Salesforce data isolation strategy (Record Types, custom fields, queues)
* Salesforce REST API authentication method (OAuth 2.0, Connected App, JWT bearer flow)
* Salesforce webhook mechanism for Case updates (Outbound Messages, Platform Events, Process Builder)
* Retry policy configuration (attempts, backoff intervals)
* Salesforce API rate limit strategy (expected volume: 100-150 submissions/day from 20k DAU, capacity planning for 3x-10x growth)

==== Feature Flag Register

*Note*: Per ADR-CS-006 (big bang cutover, not phased rollout), feature flags are minimal and used primarily for emergency rollback/kill switches.

[width="100%",cols="20%,15%,35%,30%",options="header",]
|===
|Feature Flag |Default State |Purpose |Rollback Scenario

|*enable_salesforce_feedback_submission*
|OFF (pre-cutover), ON (post-cutover)
|Enable/disable feedback submission to EngagementService → Salesforce (kill switch for emergency rollback to D365 CE)

|ON
|Enable/disable async Case creation via Event Bus (fallback to synchronous processing if Event Bus issues)
|Event Bus infrastructure failures, queue backlog unmanageable - temporary synchronous processing

|*enable_braze_notifications*
|ON
|Enable/disable Braze push notifications for Case updates (degrade gracefully if Braze integration fails)
|Braze API failures, notification delivery rate < 80% - disable notifications temporarily

|*enable_jit_contact_reconciliation*
|ON
|Enable/disable ProfileService JIT Contact reconciliation (fallback to cached Contact IDs if Salesforce unavailable)
|Salesforce API downtime, Contact reconciliation failures > 5% - use cached Contact IDs temporarily

|*enable_salesforce_webhook_processing*
|ON
|Enable/disable Salesforce webhook processing for Case updates (fallback to polling if webhook failures)
|Webhook delivery failures, authentication issues - temporary polling fallback

|===

*Feature Flag Management*:

* Feature flags managed via AWS AppConfig / LaunchDarkly / custom feature flag service (TBD in detailed design)
* Mobile App feature flags controlled server-side (no app release required for flag changes)
* Backend service feature flags configured via environment variables / configuration service
* Feature flag changes logged and audited (who changed, when, reason)
* Post-cutover monitoring: Gradual removal of feature flags once system stability confirmed (30-60 days)

== Data Architecture

This section defines the physical data models, event schemas, and API request/response formats.

=== Domain Event Schemas (CloudEvents 1.0)

All domain events follow the https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents 1.0] specification for consistency and interoperability.

==== Event: SupportCaseCreated

Published when EngagementService successfully creates a Case in Salesforce.

=== Baseline Architecture

==== Existing System Components

[width="100%",cols="25%,35%,40%",options="header",]
|===
|Component |Current State |Status

|*D365 Customer Engagement*
|Customer support platform for OTR digital customers (Mobile App, Web), handles feedback submission and case management
|**DEPRECATED** - Being replaced by Salesforce Service Cloud

|*App-Specific Customer Database*
|Stores customer contact data for Mobile App users, separate from Viva Energy systems
|**MIGRATING** - One-time migration to Salesforce, then deprecated

|*Mobile App*
|iOS/Android native apps with feedback submission form including Category, Store Name, Time of Visit, Contact Phone Number, and Free Text Message fields
|**REQUIRES UPDATE** - Integrate with ProfileService and EngagementService APIs (feedback form UI already complete)

|*Salesforce Service Cloud*
|Shared Viva Energy instance handling customer support for fuel wholesale, Shell Card customers, other retail channels
|**EXPANDING** - Adding OTR digital customer support Cases and Contacts

|*Existing AWS Infrastructure*
|SNS+SQS / EventBridge / Kinesis available for event-driven architecture
|**REUSING** - Event Bus implementation leverages existing infrastructure

|===

==== Integration Architecture

*Current state:*

* Mobile App → D365 Customer Engagement (direct integration)
* App-specific customer database → standalone (no Salesforce integration)
* No event-driven architecture (synchronous, tightly coupled)
* No Anti-Corruption Layer protecting digital channels
* Viva Energy support teams use Salesforce, OTR digital support uses D365 CE (fragmented)

==== Technical Debt

*No longer relevant* - D365 CE being deprecated, not documenting technical debt of system being retired.

*New technical debt introduced by this migration:*

* Salesforce field mapping TBD (requires coordination with Viva Energy Salesforce admin team)
* Data isolation strategy TBD (Record Types, custom fields, queues - multi-tenant governance)
* Salesforce webhook mechanism TBD (Outbound Messages vs Platform Events vs Process Builder)
* Expected feedback volume unknown (gathering data for rate limit planning)

=== Gap Analysis

==== Missing Capabilities

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|Missing Capability |Description

|*ProfileService bounded context*
|No existing service for Contact reconciliation with Salesforce - requires new microservice implementing JIT upsert by email, returning Salesforce Contact ID

|*EngagementService bounded context*
|No existing service for customer feedback facade - requires new microservice implementing Anti-Corruption Layer for Salesforce Case creation, Braze integration, async processing via Event Bus

|*Event Bus domain event pattern*
|No existing domain event publishing infrastructure - requires implementing event-driven architecture pattern using existing AWS infrastructure (SNS+SQS/EventBridge/Kinesis)

|*Async Case creation workflow*
|Current D365 CE integration is synchronous - requires implementing async processing with retry logic, exponential backoff, dead letter queue

|*Salesforce webhook integration*
|No existing capability to receive Salesforce notifications - requires implementing webhook receiver in EngagementService for Case update notifications

|*Braze push notification orchestration*
|No existing integration for Case-related push notifications - requires implementing Braze campaign triggers from EngagementService

|*Contact migration tooling*
|No existing tooling for app database → Salesforce Contact migration with upsert logic (match by email/phone/VCI)

|*Feedback form enhancements*
|Mobile App feedback form lacks structured fields (Category, Store Name, Time of Visit, Contact Phone Number) - requires UI updates

|===

==== Missing Bounded Contexts

[width="100%",cols="30%,30%,40%",options="header",]
|===
|Bounded Context |Responsibilities |Implementation Status

|*link:../bounded_context/profile.adoc[ProfileService]*
|JIT Contact reconciliation with Salesforce (upsert by email), return Salesforce Contact ID to digital channels, foundation for future Flybuys partner linking
|**NEW** - First bounded context implementation

|*link:../bounded_context/engagement.adoc[EngagementService]*
|Customer feedback submission facade, Anti-Corruption Layer for Salesforce Case creation, Braze integration for push notifications, async Case processing, webhook receiver for Case updates
|**NEW** - First bounded context implementation

|===

==== Missing Integration Patterns

[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]
|===
|Integration Pattern |Description

|*Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)*
|EngagementService → Salesforce Service Cloud - protects digital channels from Salesforce API changes, translates between OTR domain language and Salesforce

|*Conformist*
|ProfileService/EngagementService → Salesforce - conform to existing Salesforce configuration and API contracts (shared Viva Energy instance)

|*Event-Driven Architecture (OHS+PL)*
|Event Bus publishing domain events (`SupportCaseCreated`, `SupportCaseUpdated`, `CustomerFeedbackSubmitted`) for loose coupling between bounded contexts

|*Just-In-Time (JIT) Integration*
|ProfileService → Salesforce Contact reconciliation on-demand (no pre-sync)

|*Async Processing*
|EngagementService Case creation via Event Bus with retry, exponential backoff, dead letter queue

==== Integration Architecture

===== Integration Flows

*Customer Feedback Submission (Async):*

1. *Mobile App* → ProfileService: Authenticate user, get Salesforce Contact ID (JIT reconciliation)
2. *Mobile App* → EngagementService: Submit feedback (POST /feedback with Contact ID, Category, Store Name, Time of Visit, Phone, Message)
3. *EngagementService* → Mobile App: Immediate acknowledgment ("Feedback submitted")
4. *EngagementService* → Event Bus: Publish work item for async Case creation
5. *Background Worker* (EngagementService) → Salesforce: Create Case via REST API
6. *Success*: EngagementService → Event Bus: Publish `SupportCaseCreated` event
7. *EngagementService* → Braze: Trigger push notification campaign ("Your feedback has been received, Case #12345")
8. *Failure*: Retry with exponential backoff → Dead Letter Queue → Ops team alert

*Case Update Notification (Bidirectional):*

1. *Support Agent* updates/resolves Case in Salesforce
2. *Salesforce* → EngagementService: Webhook notification (Case updated)
3. *EngagementService* → Event Bus: Publish `SupportCaseUpdated` or `SupportCaseResolved` event
4. *EngagementService* → Braze: Trigger push notification campaign ("Your case has been resolved")

*Contact Reconciliation (JIT):*

1. *Mobile App user* authenticates
2. *Mobile App* → ProfileService: GET /profile/contact-id
3. *ProfileService* → Salesforce: Query Contact by email
4. *Match found*: Return existing Salesforce Contact ID
5. *No match*: Create new Contact in Salesforce, return new Contact ID
6. *ProfileService* → Mobile App: Return Salesforce Contact ID (cached by Mobile App)

===== System of Record Boundaries

[width="100%",cols="30%,35%,35%",options="header",]
|===
|Data Entity |System of Record |Rationale

|*Contact*
|Salesforce Service Cloud
|Shared Viva Energy instance, unified customer profile across all channels (digital, wholesale, Shell Card, retail)

|*Case*
|Salesforce Service Cloud
|Support agents manage Cases in Salesforce, digital channels submit via EngagementService ACL

|*Feedback Submission (transient)*
|None (no persistence)
|EngagementService processes feedback and creates Case in Salesforce, no local storage

|*Domain Events*
|Event Bus (ephemeral)
|Events published to Event Bus, consumed by subscribers, not persisted long-term (event sourcing not in scope)

|===

==== Data Architecture Principles

===== Aggregate Persistence

*ProfileService:*

* **No local aggregate persistence** - ProfileService is stateless, queries Salesforce on-demand
* Salesforce Contact is the aggregate root (owned by Salesforce)
* ProfileService acts as facade/translator, not system of record

*EngagementService:*

* **No local aggregate persistence** - EngagementService is stateless, creates Cases in Salesforce via ACL
* Salesforce Case is the aggregate root (owned by Salesforce)
* EngagementService maintains no local Case state (Conformist pattern - trust Salesforce as source of truth)
* Async processing state managed via Event Bus (work items in queue, not database)

===== Event Store

* **Event Bus** (SNS+SQS/EventBridge/Kinesis) handles domain event publishing
* Events are **ephemeral** (consumed and discarded, not persisted for event sourcing)
* No Event Store implementation in this architecture (future enhancement if needed)
* Event schema versioning TBD in Solution Architecture

=== Architecture Decisions

==== ADR-CS-001: Consolidate onto Salesforce Service Cloud (not build custom solution)

*Status*: Accepted

*Context*:

* D365 Customer Engagement not working well for digital customer support
* Viva Energy already uses Salesforce Service Cloud for fuel wholesale, Shell Card, other retail channels
* Post-merger opportunity to consolidate onto single platform
* Alternative: Build custom support platform or use different SaaS

*Decision*:

Consolidate OTR digital customer support onto Salesforce Service Cloud (shared Viva Energy instance).

*Rationale*:

* **Unified customer view**: Support agents see all interactions across channels (digital, wholesale, Shell Card, retail)
* **Platform consolidation**: Single support platform reduces operational overhead and costs
* **Proven solution**: Salesforce Service Cloud is established, feature-rich, well-supported
* **Post-merger alignment**: Strategic decision to standardize on Viva Energy platforms
* **Avoid custom development**: Building custom support platform would be costly and high-risk

*Consequences*:

* ✅ Unified customer support across Viva Energy Group
* ✅ Reduced operational complexity (single platform vs two)
* ✅ Leverage Salesforce capabilities (case routing, knowledge base, AI, omnichannel)
* ⚠️ Conformist pattern required (shared instance, conform to existing configuration)
* ⚠️ Multi-tenant governance needed (data isolation, security, queues)
* ❌ Less control over platform evolution (SaaS vendor, shared instance)

==== ADR-CS-002: Implement ProfileService and EngagementService as first DDD bounded contexts

*Status*: Accepted

*Context*:

* OTR target architecture uses Domain-Driven Design with bounded contexts
* This migration is opportunity to establish first implementation
* Alternative: Direct Mobile App → Salesforce integration (no bounded contexts)
* Alternative: Single monolithic service for all customer-facing APIs

*Decision*:

Implement ProfileService and EngagementService as separate bounded contexts following DDD strategic patterns.

*Rationale*:

* **Foundation for target architecture**: First implementation of DDD pattern for future bounded contexts (Flybuys, LocationService, PaymentService)
* **Separation of concerns**: ProfileService handles identity/Contact reconciliation, EngagementService handles support/feedback (different responsibilities, different change rates)
* **Anti-Corruption Layer**: EngagementService protects digital channels from Salesforce API changes
* **Reusability**: ProfileService Contact reconciliation reused for Flybuys integration
* **Event-driven architecture**: Establishes pattern for loose coupling between bounded contexts

*Consequences*:

* ✅ Establishes DDD architecture foundation for OTR
* ✅ Reusable ProfileService for Flybuys and future integrations
* ✅ Digital channels protected from Salesforce API changes (ACL)
* ✅ Clear bounded context boundaries and responsibilities
* ⚠️ Increased initial complexity (two new microservices vs direct integration)
* ⚠️ Requires Event Bus infrastructure implementation
* ⚠️ Team must learn DDD patterns and bounded context design

==== ADR-CS-003: Async Case creation via Event Bus (not synchronous)

*Status*: Accepted

*Context*:

* Current D365 CE integration is synchronous (user waits for Case creation)
* Alternative: Keep synchronous integration (Mobile App → EngagementService → Salesforce synchronously)
* Salesforce API may experience downtime or latency

*Decision*:

Implement async Case creation via Event Bus with immediate user acknowledgment, retry logic, exponential backoff, and dead letter queue.

*Rationale*:

* **Non-blocking user experience**: User gets immediate "Feedback submitted" confirmation, not waiting for Salesforce API
* **Resilience**: If Salesforce is down, feedback still accepted, Case created when Salesforce recovers
* **Retry logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff handles transient failures
* **Operational visibility**: Dead letter queue alerts ops team to persistent failures
* **Scalability**: Queue buffering handles traffic spikes

*Consequences*:

* ✅ Better user experience (no waiting for Salesforce API)
* ✅ Resilient to Salesforce downtime (queue buffers work)
* ✅ Automatic retry reduces manual intervention
* ✅ Queue depth monitoring provides operational visibility
* ⚠️ Eventual consistency (user gets success notification after Case created, not immediately)
* ⚠️ Increased complexity (Event Bus, background workers, retry logic, DLQ)
* ⚠️ Requires monitoring and alerting for DLQ

==== ADR-CS-004: ProfileService uses email as primary matching key (not VCI)

*Status*: Accepted

*Context*:

* ProfileService needs to reconcile Mobile App users as Salesforce Contacts
* Alternative matching keys: VCI (Viva Consumer ID), email, phone, Salesforce External ID
* Email changes are rare but possible

*Decision*:

Use email address as primary matching key for Contact reconciliation (JIT upsert by email).

*Rationale*:

* **Availability**: Email always available for authenticated users
* **Uniqueness**: Email is unique identifier in Salesforce and Mobile App
* **Salesforce standard**: Salesforce Contact uses email as standard lookup field
* **Simplicity**: Single matching key simplifies upsert logic
* **Edge case acceptable**: Email changes are rare, manual cleanup acceptable

*Consequences*:

* ✅ Simple upsert logic (query by email, create if not found)
* ✅ Leverages Salesforce standard email field
* ✅ Email always available from authentication
* ⚠️ Email changes create duplicate Contacts (rare edge case, manual cleanup)
* ⚠️ Future enhancement: Add VCI as Salesforce External ID for stable matching

==== ADR-CS-005: No Case migration from D365 CE (fresh start)

*Status*: Accepted

*Context*:

* D365 CE contains historical customer support Cases
* Alternative: Migrate historical Cases to Salesforce (preserve support history)
* Alternative: Archive D365 CE Cases separately (read-only access)

*Decision*:

Do not migrate historical Cases from D365 CE to Salesforce. Start fresh in Salesforce.

*Rationale*:

* **Limited value**: Historical D365 CE Cases not critical for future support
* **Data quality**: D365 CE Case data may be inconsistent or incomplete
* **Complexity**: Case migration requires mapping D365 CE schema to Salesforce, data transformation, validation
* **Cost-benefit**: Migration effort outweighs value of historical data
* **Archive option**: D365 CE Cases can be archived separately if needed (read-only access for auditing)

*Consequences*:

* ✅ Simpler migration (Contacts only, no Case migration)
* ✅ Faster time to value (no Case migration delay)
* ✅ Clean start in Salesforce (no legacy data quality issues)
* ⚠️ Historical Cases not visible in Salesforce (support agents can't see old Cases)
* ⚠️ D365 CE must remain accessible temporarily for historical Case lookups (if needed)
* ❌ Loss of historical Case insights (reporting, analytics on old Cases)

==== ADR-CS-006: Big bang cutover (not phased rollout)

*Status*: Accepted

*Context*:

* Alternative: Phased rollout with feature flags (pilot users first, gradual enablement)
* Alternative: Parallel run (submit to both D365 CE and Salesforce temporarily)
* Flybuys integration uses phased rollout (AS-1, AS-2, AS-3 architecture states)

*Decision*:

Big bang cutover - migrate Contacts, deploy ProfileService and EngagementService, switch Mobile App, retire D365 CE.

*Rationale*:

* **Simplicity**: No parallel run complexity, no feature flag management
* **Faster D365 CE retirement**: No extended transition period maintaining two systems
* **Limited risk**: Customer support not mission-critical (not payment processing), rollback possible
* **User base manageable**: OTR digital customers smaller than Flybuys integration scope
* **Different use case**: Flybuys phased rollout manages points accrual complexity, support feedback is simpler

*Consequences*:

* ✅ Simpler deployment (single cutover, no AS-1/AS-2/AS-3 states)
* ✅ Faster D365 CE retirement (no extended parallel run)
* ✅ No feature flag complexity or pilot user management
* ⚠️ Higher cutover risk (all users switch at once)
* ⚠️ Requires comprehensive testing before cutover
* ⚠️ Rollback plan required (revert to D365 CE if critical issues)

==== ADR-CS-007: EngagementService receives Salesforce webhooks for Case updates

*Status*: Accepted

*Context*:

* Support agents update/resolve Cases in Salesforce
* Need to notify customers of Case status changes via push notifications
* Alternative: Poll Salesforce API for Case updates (inefficient)
* Alternative: No customer notifications (agents contact customers directly)

*Decision*:

Salesforce sends webhook notifications to EngagementService when Cases are updated/resolved. EngagementService triggers Braze push notifications.

*Rationale*:

* **Real-time notifications**: Customer notified immediately when agent resolves Case
* **Efficient**: Webhook push model (not polling)
* **Event-driven**: Aligns with event-driven architecture pattern
* **Better customer experience**: Proactive notification vs waiting for agent contact

*Consequences*:

* ✅ Real-time customer notifications for Case updates
* ✅ Efficient push model (no polling overhead)
* ✅ Bidirectional integration (Mobile App → Salesforce → Mobile App)
* ⚠️ Salesforce webhook mechanism TBD (Outbound Messages vs Platform Events vs Process Builder)
* ⚠️ Webhook authentication and security required
* ⚠️ EngagementService must handle webhook retries and failures

* **Backwards Compatibility**: Minor changes (new optional fields, new endpoints) don't require version bump

==== When to Version

*Breaking changes requiring new major version*:
- Removing or renaming fields in request/response
- Changing field data types (e.g., string → number)
- Changing authentication mechanism
- Removing endpoints

*Non-breaking changes not requiring version bump*:
- Adding new optional fields to request/response
- Adding new endpoints
- Expanding enum values (e.g., adding new feedback category)
- Improving error messages

==== Parallel Version Support

* Support N and N-1 versions concurrently for 6 months
* Deprecation notice: 3 months before sunsetting old version
* Mobile App must upgrade to new version within deprecation window

<<<
== Transition Architecture

This section defines the evolution from baseline (D365 CE) to target state (Salesforce Service Cloud + ProfileService + EngagementService).

=== Transition Approach

*Big Bang Cutover*: Per ADR-CS-006, this transition uses a single cutover approach rather than phased rollout. All users switch from D365 CE to Salesforce simultaneously after Contact migration completion.

=== Transition States

==== TS-0: Baseline State (Current)

*Characteristics*:
* D365 Customer Engagement handles all digital customer feedback
* App-specific database stores customer Contact data
* No ProfileService or EngagementService
* No event-driven architecture
* Synchronous feedback submission

*Components Active*:
- D365 Customer Engagement
- App-specific customer database
- Mobile App (current version with D365 CE integration)

==== TS-1: Build & Test

*Duration*: 8 weeks

*Activities*:

* Build ProfileService microservice (JIT Contact reconciliation API)
* Build EngagementService microservice (feedback submission API, ACL for Salesforce Case creation, Braze integration, webhook receiver)
* Implement Event Bus infrastructure (SNS+SQS/EventBridge/Kinesis)
* Develop Contact migration tool (app database → Salesforce upsert by email/phone/VCI)
* Update Mobile App API integration (ProfileService + EngagementService endpoints - feedback form UI already complete)
* Integration testing (ProfileService ↔ Salesforce, EngagementService ↔ Salesforce, EngagementService ↔ Braze)
* UAT with test Salesforce sandbox environment

*Components Active*:
- D365 Customer Engagement (still active, unchanged)
- App-specific customer database (still active)
- ProfileService (non-production, testing only)
- EngagementService (non-production, testing only)
- Event Bus (non-production)
- Salesforce Sandbox (testing)

*Exit Criteria*:
- All integration tests pass
- UAT sign-off from business stakeholders
- Contact migration tool validated in sandbox
- Mobile App updates tested with non-production APIs

==== TS-2: Contact Migration

*Duration*: 1 week

*Activities*:
* Execute Contact migration (app database → Salesforce production)
* Validation: 100% data integrity check (email/phone/VCI matching)
* Reconciliation report: New Contacts created vs existing Contacts updated
* Freeze app database Contact updates during migration window
* ProfileService smoke testing (verify Contact lookups work in Salesforce production)

*Components Active*:
- D365 Customer Engagement (still active, users unaffected)
- Salesforce Production (Contacts migrated, no Cases yet)
- ProfileService (production deployed, not integrated with Mobile App yet)
- App-specific customer database (frozen, read-only)

=== Rollback Plan

==== Rollback Triggers

* Feedback submission success rate < 95% (below acceptable threshold)
* Data loss or corruption detected in Salesforce
* Salesforce API rate limits exceeded (Cases not created within SLA)
* Critical bug blocking customer feedback submission

==== Rollback Procedure

1. **Revert Mobile App** to previous version (remove ProfileService/EngagementService integration, restore D365 CE integration)
2. **Stop EngagementService** Case creation (prevent duplicate Cases in Salesforce)
3. **Re-enable D365 CE** for customer feedback submission
4. **Investigate root cause** (EngagementService logs, Salesforce API errors, Event Bus queue issues)
5. **Fix and re-test** in sandbox environment
6. **Retry cutover** when issues resolved

==== Rollback Limitations

* Cases created in Salesforce during cutover period remain in Salesforce (no reverse migration)
* Contacts migrated to Salesforce remain (no rollback to app database)
* Rollback only affects Mobile App integration (not data migration)

=== Architectural Scope Boundaries

==== Capabilities Included

*Business Capabilities*:

* **Customer Feedback Submission**: Mobile App users can submit structured feedback (Category, Store Name, Time of Visit, Phone, Free Text Message) via EngagementService
* **Customer Contact Management**: Just-In-Time (JIT) Contact reconciliation with Salesforce via ProfileService, ensuring every Mobile App user has a Salesforce Contact record
* **Case Management Integration**: EngagementService creates Salesforce Cases asynchronously for customer feedback, support agents manage Cases in Salesforce Service Cloud
* **Customer Notifications**: Push notifications via Braze when Cases are created, updated, or resolved (bidirectional integration: Mobile App → Salesforce → Mobile App)
* **Unified Customer View**: Support agents see OTR digital customer feedback alongside other Viva Energy channels (fuel wholesale, Shell Card, retail) in single Salesforce instance
* **Contact Data Migration**: One-time migration of app-specific customer database Contacts to Salesforce with upsert logic (email/phone/VCI matching)

*Technical Capabilities*:

* **ProfileService Bounded Context**: First DDD bounded context implementation - JIT Contact reconciliation, Salesforce API facade, foundation for Flybuys integration
* **EngagementService Bounded Context**: First DDD bounded context implementation - Customer feedback submission BFF, Anti-Corruption Layer for Salesforce, Braze integration orchestration
* **Event-Driven Architecture**: Domain event publishing via Event Bus (SNS+SQS/EventBridge/Kinesis) for `SupportCaseCreated`, `SupportCaseUpdated`, `CustomerFeedbackSubmitted` events
* **Async Processing Pattern**: Non-blocking Case creation with retry logic, exponential backoff, dead letter queue for operational resilience
* **Anti-Corruption Layer Pattern**: EngagementService protects digital channels from Salesforce API changes, translates between OTR domain language and Salesforce
* **Conformist Pattern**: ProfileService and EngagementService conform to existing Salesforce configuration (shared Viva Energy instance, multi-tenant governance)
* **Salesforce Integration**: REST API integration for Contact CRUD and Case creation, webhook receiver for Case update notifications
* **Braze Integration**: Push notification campaign triggers for Case lifecycle events (created, updated, resolved)
* **Observability & Monitoring**: Dashboards, metrics, alerting for feedback submission rate, queue depth, API errors, Case creation latency
* **Feature Flag Management**: Kill switches for emergency rollback (enable_salesforce_feedback_submission, enable_async_case_creation, etc.)

==== Capabilities Excluded

*Business Capabilities Explicitly Out of Scope*:

* **Historical Case Migration**: D365 CE Cases not migrated to Salesforce (ADR-CS-005 - fresh start, no Case migration)

* **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: ProfileService and EngagementService use same data model for reads/writes (no separate read models)
* **Local Aggregate Persistence**: ProfileService and EngagementService are stateless (Salesforce is System of Record, no local database for Contact/Case)
* **Saga Orchestration**: No distributed transactions or saga patterns required (single-step Case creation, not multi-step workflow)
* **API Gateway Advanced Features**: Rate limiting, API versioning, API key management deferred to detailed design (basic routing only)
* **GraphQL API**: ProfileService and EngagementService expose REST APIs only (GraphQL not required)
* **Real-Time Sync**: Salesforce Contact updates by support agents not synced back to ProfileService (eventual consistency acceptable via JIT reconciliation)
* **Multi-Region Deployment**: Single AWS region deployment (no multi-region failover/disaster recovery in this phase)
* **Blue-Green Deployment**: Big bang cutover (ADR-CS-006), not blue-green or canary deployment strategy
* **A/B Testing Framework**: Feature flags for rollback only, not for A/B testing or experimentation
* **Custom Authentication**: Microsoft Entra External ID used for Mobile App authentication (no custom authentication logic in ProfileService/EngagementService)
* **Data Residency Compliance**: Salesforce data residency governed by Viva Energy Salesforce configuration (no OTR-specific data residency requirements)

*Future Bounded Contexts Not in Scope*:

* **LoyaltyService**: Flybuys integration, reward preferences, transaction adjudication (separate initiative)
* **LocationService**: Store finder, proximity features, geofencing (separate initiative)
* **PaymentService**: Payment processing, subscription billing (separate initiative)
* **RecommendationService**: Personalized recommendations, next-best offers (separate initiative)

*Integration Patterns Not in Scope*:

* **Shared Kernel**: No shared domain model between ProfileService and EngagementService (separate bounded contexts with clear boundaries)
* **Partnership**: No joint development or coordination with external teams (Conformist pattern - we conform to Salesforce)
* **Customer-Supplier (we're upstream)**: No downstream systems depend on ProfileService/EngagementService APIs yet (future bounded contexts will consume domain events)

== Solution Validation

This section defines the validation criteria and testing approach for the solution.

=== Functional Validation

==== ProfileService API Testing

*Test Scenarios*:
1. **Happy Path**: Authenticated user requests Contact ID, existing Contact found in Salesforce, Contact ID returned
2. **JIT Creation**: Authenticated user requests Contact ID, no existing Contact, new Contact created in Salesforce, Contact ID returned
3. **Salesforce API Failure**: Salesforce unavailable, ProfileService returns 500 error, user retries
4. **Invalid JWT**: Unauthenticated request, ProfileService returns 401 error

*Acceptance Criteria*:
- Contact reconciliation success rate > 99.5%
- JIT Contact creation completes within 500ms (p95)

==== EngagementService API Testing

*Test Scenarios*:
1. **Happy Path**: Valid feedback submission, immediate 202 Accepted response, Case created in Salesforce within 5 minutes, Braze notification delivered
2. **Invalid Category**: Invalid feedback category, 400 Bad Request response with validation error
3. **Salesforce Downtime**: Salesforce unavailable during async Case creation, message queued, retry logic executes, Case created when Salesforce recovers
4. **Dead Letter Queue**: Case creation fails after 5 retries, message moved to DLQ, ops team alerted
5. **Webhook Notification**: Support agent resolves Case in Salesforce, webhook triggers EngagementService, Braze push notification sent to customer

*Acceptance Criteria*:
- Feedback submission success rate > 99.5% (including async Case creation)
- Async Case creation completes within 5 minutes (p95)
- Webhook delivery success rate > 99%

=== Non-Functional Validation

==== Performance Testing

*Load Testing*:

*Baseline*: Expected 100-150 submissions/day from 20k DAU (~0.5-0.75% submission rate)

- **Normal Load**: 1 submission/minute sustained for 2 hours (simulate typical daily pattern)
- **3x Load**: 3 submissions/minute sustained for 1 hour (simulate busy period, 450 submissions/day)
- **Peak Load (10x)**: 10 submissions/minute for 15 minutes (simulate incident scenario, app outage causing backlog)
- **Stress Test**: 50 submissions/minute for 5 minutes (find breaking point, 20x normal)

*Validation*:
- API response time p95 < 1 second under 10x load
- Event Bus queue depth remains manageable (< 100 messages)
- No Case creation failures, all submissions processed successfully
- Auto-scaling triggers appropriately for sustained load > 3x baseline

*Acceptance Criteria*:
- NFR-PERF-001 through NFR-PERF-006 validated under realistic load (3x and 10x baseline)
- Auto-scaling triggers within 2 minutes of load increase
- System handles 10x peak gracefully, 20x stress test identifies limits

==== Resilience Testing

*Salesforce API Failure Scenarios*:
1. **Complete Outage**: Salesforce unavailable for 2 hours, Event Bus queues buffer work, Cases created when Salesforce recovers
2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Salesforce rate limit hit, queue throttling activates, Cases created within SLA

*Acceptance Criteria*:
- NFR-AVAIL-004 validated (graceful degradation during Salesforce downtime)
- Circuit breaker activates after 5 consecutive failures

==== Security Validation

*Penetration Testing*:
- API authentication bypass attempts
- SQL injection attempts
- Webhook signature validation bypass

*Acceptance Criteria*:
- NFR-SEC-001 through NFR-SEC-010 validated
- OWASP API Security Top 10 compliance verified

=== Integration Validation

==== End-to-End Testing

*Full User Journey*:
1. User authenticates via Microsoft Entra External ID
2. Mobile App requests Contact ID from ProfileService (JIT reconciliation)
3. User submits feedback via EngagementService
4. Background worker creates Case in Salesforce
5. Braze notification delivered to user
6. Support agent resolves Case in Salesforce
7. Salesforce webhook triggers EngagementService
8. Braze notification delivered to user

*Acceptance Criteria*:
- End-to-end flow completes successfully in UAT
- User receives both "feedback submitted" and "case resolved" notifications
