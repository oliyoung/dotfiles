# Building PDFs from AsciiDoc

This repository includes a build script to convert all AsciiDoc files to PDF format while maintaining the folder structure.

## Prerequisites

Install the required Ruby gems:

```bash
gem install asciidoctor-pdf
gem install asciidoctor-diagram
```

## Usage

Run the build script from the repository root:

```bash
./build-pdf.sh
```

The script will:

1. Find all `.adoc` files in the repository
2. Convert each file to PDF using `asciidoctor-pdf`
3. Maintain the original folder structure under the `pdf/` directory
4. Apply the custom theme from `asciidoc/theme.yml`
5. Use custom fonts from `asciidoc/fonts/`
6. Enable diagram support via `asciidoctor-diagram`

## Output

PDFs are generated in the `pdf/` directory with the same folder structure as the source files.

Example:
```
initiatives/digital_menu_board.adoc
  → pdf/initiatives/digital_menu_board.pdf

architecture_definitions/digital_menu_board.adoc
  → pdf/architecture_definitions/digital_menu_board.pdf
```

## Build Status

The script provides:

- ✓ Success/failure status for each file
- Summary of total files processed
- List of any failed files

## Notes

- The `pdf/` directory is gitignored and won't be committed to the repository
- If the theme file or fonts directory is missing, the build continues with warnings
- Diagram generation requires Graphviz to be installed on your system
