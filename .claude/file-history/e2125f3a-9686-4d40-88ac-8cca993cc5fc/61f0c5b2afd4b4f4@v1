== What We're Building

A new Loyalty system that allows all OTRG customers to

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Feature | Description

| Link their Flybuys account
| via the OTR mobile app (OAuth secure linking)

| Choose their reward preference
| earn Flybuys points OR OTR fuel discounts at every transaction

| Scan Flybuys cards at POS
| physical cards, mobile app barcodes, or Apple/Google Wallet passes

| Earn Flybuys points automatically
| points post to Flybuys account within 24 hours

| Check Flybuys balance
| in OTR mobile app - real-time balance queries with caching
|===

== Architecture Approach

NOTE: This and the xref:initiatives:salesforce_customer_support.adoc[Salesforce Customer Support] initiative are the first implementations of the overall Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture for OTR Group's digital platform. Depending on sequencing, some architectural elements may be delivered in either initiative.

At its core, this is a foundational architecture with the goal of creating a clear, shared structure for how our digital platforms represent Customers, Decisions, and Outcomes, and to distribute a common understanding of domain knowledge between business and technology.

Instead of embedding business rules and assumptions across apps, POS flows, and third-party tools, it gives teams a common frame of reference, improves communication across product and technology, and makes complex customer journeys easier to reason about, change, and govern.

Importantly, this structure is not specific to this single project, or even loyalty as a capability, it aims to provide a repeatable way to introduce all the capabilities presented in the road-map, from promotions or subscriptions to future partners, without re-wiring core customer and commerce flows each time.

By making domain knowledge explicit and stable, the architecture reduces long-term complexity, lowers delivery risk, and enables the digital and eCommerce ecosystem to evolve with confidence as business priorities shift.

=== New "Profile Service"

Customer partner account management

- Handles Flybuys account linking via OAuth
- Stores customer reward preferences (Flybuys vs OTR)
- Manages partner link status (linked/unlinked)

=== New "Loyalty Service"

Transaction processing and partner integration

- Resolves loyalty credentials at POS (Flybuys cards → customer identity)
- Processes transaction adjudication (calculates rewards)
- Generates nightly batch files for Flybuys
- Queries Flybuys balances (with Redis caching)

=== New "Engagement Service"

Customer engagement and notifications

- Consumes domain events from Profile and Loyalty services
- Triggers customer campaigns and notifications (push, email, in-app)
- Anti-Corruption Layer for Braze marketing automation
- Tracks campaign delivery and customer engagement

== Customer Journey

=== Mobile App (Account Linking)

. Customer taps "_Link Flybuys Account_" in OTR app
. Redirects to Flybuys for secure login
. Customer authorises OTR to access their Flybuys account
. Returns to OTR app - account linked, reward preference set to Flybuys Points
. *Customer receives welcome notification*: "_You're earning Flybuys points now!_" (via Engagement Service)

    participant OTR as OTR Mobile App
    participant Flybuys as Flybuys Website
    participant Engagement as Engagement Service

    Customer ->> OTR: Tap "Link Flybuys Account"
    OTR ->> Flybuys: Redirect for secure login
    Customer ->> Flybuys: Enter credentials & authorize OTR
    Flybuys -->> OTR: Authorization success + redirect
    OTR ->> OTR: Link Flybuys account\nSet reward preference = Flybuys Points
    OTR ->> Engagement: Trigger welcome notification
    Engagement -->> Customer: "You're earning Flybuys points now!"
----

=== Point-of-Sale (Earning Rewards)

. *Customer* scans *Loyalty Credentials* at POS
. POS sends *Loyalty Credentials* to Loyalty Service for resolution
. *Loyalty Service* identifies customer and reward preference
. Transaction processed through *EagleEye* for *Transaction Adjudication*
. Points earned, stored locally, batch sent to Flybuys overnight
. *Customer receives transaction notification*: "_You earned 150 Flybuys points!_" (within seconds via Engagement Service)
. Customer sees points in Flybuys app within 24 hours

== Implementation Phases

Phased Rollout via Feature Flags

| All customers
| Baseline established

| *TS-1: Foundation*
| Profile Service (dual-write to legacy)
| 500 pilot users
| 100% response parity with legacy API

| *TS-2: Linking*
| OAuth account linking, balance queries
| Pilot stores, gradual rollout
| >95% OAuth success rate

|===

*Rollback Strategy*: Feature flags allow instant rollback at each phase without code deployment.

== Non-Functional Requirements Met

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Requirement | Target | How We Achieve It

| *Credential Resolution Speed*
| <500ms p95
| Direct database lookup, cached Flybuys data

| *Balance Query Speed*
| <2s p95
| Redis cache with 5-minute TTL, circuit breaker on Flybuys API

| *System Uptime*
| 99.9% (ProfileService), 99.5% (LoyaltyService), 99.5% (EngagementService)
| Azure auto-scaling, health checks, monitoring

| *Notification Latency*
| <500ms p95 (event to notification trigger)
| Event-driven architecture, Braze webhook integration

| *Batch Window*
| Complete within 1 hour (01:00-02:00 UTC)
| Optimized aggregation queries, parallel SFTP upload

| *Points Posting*
| >98% acknowledged within 24 hours
| Retry logic, manual intervention alerts

| *Data Residency*
| All customer data in Australia East region
| Azure region pinning, compliance validation
|===

== Risks & Mitigation

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation

| *Flybuys API downtime*
| Customers can't link accounts, balance queries fail
| Circuit breaker returns cached balance, OAuth linking queued for retry

| *Batch file transmission failure*
| Points don't post to Flybuys
| Automatic retry with exponential backoff, manual intervention alerts, regenerate from database

| *Braze webhook failures*
| Customers don't receive notifications
| Circuit breaker with dead letter queue, retry logic, monitoring alerts

| *OAuth token expiry*
| Partner API calls fail silently
| Automated token refresh every 50 minutes, monitoring alerts on refresh failures

| *POS integration delays*
| Checkout slowdowns
| <500ms p95 SLA, timeout fallback to proceed without loyalty

| *Data migration errors*
| Customer linking status lost
| Dual-write during TS-1, legacy remains authoritative, validation scripts
|===

== Key Decisions Made

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Decision | Rationale | Trade-off Accepted

| *Event-driven integration* (not REST between services)
| Loose coupling, resilience to downstream failures
| Eventual consistency (acceptable per business requirements)

| *Engagement Service as Braze ACL*
| Isolates domain model from marketing platform changes
| Additional service to maintain (justifies platform independence)

| *Redis cache for balance queries*
| Reduce Flybuys API costs, improve response times
| 5-minute cache staleness (acceptable for balance display)

| *Nightly batch file* (not real-time)
| Meets Flybuys integration standard, simplifies retry logic
| 24-hour delay for points posting (acceptable per Flybuys SLA)

| *Dual-write during TS-1*
| Zero-risk rollback, gradual validation
| Temporary complexity

| *30-day TTL on RewardTransactions*
| Audit trail summary only, reduces database costs
| Full audit trail in external system (D365 Commerce)
|===

| Establishes a standard pattern approach to managing link:../ubiquitous_language.adoc#coalition-partner[Coalition Partner] relationships, beyond supporting Flybuys

| *Dealer Loyalty*
| Creates a generic Loyalty interface uncoupled from end-client POS and terminals, capable of supporting any future Loyalty programme via any channel

| *FTUE*
| Provides feature flags and automatic loyalty programme enrollment consistent across brand and delivery channel
