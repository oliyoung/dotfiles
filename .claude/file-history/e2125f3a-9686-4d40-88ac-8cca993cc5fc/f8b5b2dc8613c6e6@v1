== Problem Statement

=== Current State Pain Points

Digital menu boards (DMBs) in Subway stores operated by OTR currently rely on manual pricing updates managed by store staff or through the Menuzen platform (managed by Amped Digital agency). This manual process creates several operational and customer experience issues:

* *Manual Pricing Updates:* Store managers or Amped Digital must manually update DMB pricing when prices change in D365 Commerce, creating operational overhead and delay
* *Pricing Lag:* Pricing changes in D365 Commerce can take 2-7 days to reflect on DMBs, particularly for promotional pricing updates
* *No Single Source of Truth:* DMB pricing exists separately from POS pricing (D365 Commerce), requiring dual maintenance
* *Error-Prone Process:* Manual entry increases risk of pricing discrepancies between POS and DMB displays
* *Limited Scalability:* Manual approach doesn't scale to multiple QSR brands (Oporto, Red Rooster planned)

=== Business Impact

* *Customer Experience:* Pricing mismatches between DMB and POS erode customer trust and cause friction at checkout
* *Operational Overhead:* Manual pricing updates consume store manager time that could be spent on customer service
* *Promotional Effectiveness:* Delayed pricing updates reduce effectiveness of time-sensitive promotions
* *Brand Risk:* Incorrect pricing displays expose OTR to compliance risk and brand reputation damage
* *Expansion Blocker:* Manual process blocks DMB rollout to other OTR QSR brands

=== Root Cause Analysis

Store managers and third-party DMB platforms (Menuzen) don't have automated, API-based access to D365 Commerce pricing data in a format optimised for digital signage consumption.

The underlying causes:

* D365 Commerce pricing data resides in Azure back-office domain, while customer-facing digital experiences (DMBs, mobile app, web) operate on AWS ecommerce domain
* No standardised product catalog API exists for OTR's customer-facing channels to consume pricing data
* DMB platform (Menuzen) requires RESTful API access, but D365 Commerce doesn't expose direct API for external consumers
* Cross-cloud integration pattern (Azure → AWS) has not been established for back-office data consumption

This is **not** a case of "we don't have a pricing API" (that's the output). The root cause is that **store operations and customer-facing digital channels lack automated access to authoritative pricing data**, forcing manual reconciliation and creating operational friction.

=== Alternatives Considered

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Alternative | Pros | Cons / Why Not Selected

| *Azure-hosted API (near D365 source)*
| Lower latency to D365 Commerce; simpler data extraction
| Ecommerce team operates on AWS per commercial agreement; inconsistent with customer-facing platform strategy; Azure expertise not in ecommerce team

| *Direct D365 Commerce API access*
| No intermediate service; "real-time" pricing
| D365 Commerce not designed for external API consumers; tight coupling to back-office system; no abstraction layer for future back-office changes

| *Manual exports to DMB platform*
| No new infrastructure; existing process
| Doesn't solve root cause (manual overhead, pricing lag, error risk); not scalable to multiple brands

| *Selected: AWS ProductCatalogService with S3 data contract*
| Clear domain separation (Azure back-office, AWS ecommerce); loose coupling via data contract; ecommerce team uses native AWS platform; scalable to multiple consumers (mobile app, web, other DMB platforms)
| Cross-cloud integration complexity; scheduled sync introduces 1-24 hour data lag (acceptable per requirements)

== What We're Building

A cross-cloud pricing integration that enables third-party digital menu boards (DMBs) operating in OTRG stores and QSRs to display accurate, current pricing from D365 Commerce via a new ProductCatalogService on AWS.

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Feature | Description

| Current pricing API
| RESTful API exposing product pricing from D365 Commerce to Menuzen DMB platform (managed by Amped Digital)

| Automated data synchronisation
| Configurable scheduled ingestion of pricing data from Azure (D365 Commerce) to AWS (ecommerce domain) - hourly or daily

| Multi-store pricing support
| Store-specific pricing with price group hierarchy (chain/region/store levels)

| Product catalog queries
| Structured product data with categories, descriptions, modifiers, and availability

| Integration monitoring
| Automated alerts for data pipeline failures, API degradation, and stale data detection

| Scalable architecture
| Foundation for future product catalog consumers

| Decoupled from back-office system changes
| ProductCatalogService abstracts D365 Commerce implementation details; back-office pricing system changes don't break DMB integration
|===

<<<
== Architecture Approach

This is a **cross-cloud domain integration** for OTR Group's digital platform, establishing a xref:bounded-contexts:product_catalog.adoc[ProductCatalogService] bounded context and cross-cloud data pipeline that bridges Azure-based back-office systems with AWS-based customer-facing channels.

This architecture creates a clear separation between domains while maintaining a unified view of product and pricing data. The xref:bounded-contexts:product_catalog.adoc[ProductCatalogService] acts as a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) and Anti-Corruption Layer, translating D365 Commerce pricing structures into AWS-native APIs optimised for digital consumer experiences.

=== Design Principles

==== Keep it simple

Start with scheduled sync (overnight). Add webhooks/real-time only if business requires it.

==== Clear ownership boundaries

Back-office owns export (Azure), ecommerce owns API (AWS). Clean handoff at data ingestion.

==== Pricing must match POS

DMBs display what customers pay at checkout.

==== Loose coupling

Back-office can change export mechanism (Data Lake, Dataverse, direct export) as long as S3 contract is met.

==== Each team uses native tools

Azure Data Factory for back-office, AWS services for ecommerce. No cross-cloud complexity within teams.

=== New xref:bounded-contexts:product_catalog.adoc[ProductCatalogService]

Product catalog and pricing facade

- Ingests pricing data from D365 Commerce via S3 data export
- Provides RESTful API for product and pricing queries
- Manages store-specific pricing with hierarchy (chain/region/store)
- Foundation for future catalog consumers (mobile app, online ordering)
- AWS-native implementation (Lambda/ECS, RDS PostgreSQL, S3, API Gateway)

=== Pricing Data Source

*POS Pricing Context Required*

This integration requires **POS channel pricing** from D365 Commerce, not simplified app pricing exports.

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Pricing Source | Characteristics | Suitability for DMB

| *POS Channel Pricing*
| Full price group hierarchy (POS-AU-NAT, POS-SA-R), regional variations, promotional rules, channel-specific pricing
| *Required* - DMBs must display identical prices to in-store POS systems

| *App Pricing Pathway*
| Simplified export for OTR App, may lack complete price group mappings, potentially cached/stale
| *Insufficient* - Missing price group context needed for multi-region pricing
|===

=== Cross-Cloud Data Pipeline

Cross-cloud data synchronisation infrastructure

==== Azure-Side Export (Back-Office Responsibility)

The back-office teams own the Azure-side export mechanism:

. *D365 Commerce* exports pricing data using Data Management Framework
. *Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2* receives exported files (Parquet format expected)
. *Azure Data Factory / Microsoft Fabric* orchestrates cross-cloud transfer to AWS S3

*Implementation Flexibility:* The specific Azure-side mechanism (Data Lake export, Dataverse sync, or direct D365 export) is the back-office team's decision. ProductCatalogService only requires that data arrives in S3 conforming to the agreed data contract (schema, format, frequency).

==== AWS-Side Ingestion (Ecommerce Team Responsibility)

The ecommerce team owns the AWS-side ingestion and API:

. *S3 Bucket* receives pricing exports (cross-account access from Azure)
. *S3 Event Notification* triggers ingestion pipeline when new file arrives
. *AWS Glue / Lambda* validates data quality, transforms to API schema, handles errors
. *RDS PostgreSQL* stores validated pricing data optimised for API queries
. *SNS Alerts* notify operations team of pipeline failures or data quality issues

*Foundation Pattern:* This cross-cloud pipeline pattern is reusable for future back-office data integrations (inventory, promotions, loyalty data)

|===

<<<
== Key Decisions Made

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Decision | Rationale | Trade-off Accepted

| *AWS platform for ProductCatalogService* (not Azure)
| Ecommerce team operates on AWS, existing commercial agreement, aligns with customer-facing workload strategy
| Cross-cloud integration complexity (Azure → AWS data transfer)

| *S3 data contract* (not REST API or database replication)
| Loose coupling between domains, asynchronous processing, simplifies cross-cloud networking, resilient to downtime
| Data freshness (scheduled sync 1-24 hours, not real-time)

| *RDS PostgreSQL* (not DynamoDB)
| Relational data model (products, prices, stores, price groups), supports complex queries, familiar technology for team
| Additional operational overhead vs. managed NoSQL (acceptable for pilot scale)

| *Configurable scheduled sync* (not event-driven)
| Simpler implementation, meets DMB refresh requirements (hourly or daily pricing updates), reduces cross-cloud complexity
| Data staleness (1-24 hours depending on schedule), not suitable for real-time use cases

| *API Gateway + ECS/Lambda* (not direct RDS access)
| Secure API exposure, authentication, abstraction layer, scalable architecture
| Additional latency (~50ms), increased architecture complexity

| *Conformist pattern with Menuzen* (not custom integration)
| External platform (maintained by Amped Digital), we don't control their API, simpler to adapt to their contract than negotiate changes
| Less control over API design, must accommodate their requirements

| *Price group hierarchy* (not flat pricing)
| Supports franchise pricing variations, regional promotions, chain-wide pricing
| Additional complexity in price resolution logic, more data to synchronise

| *Optional Redis caching* (not mandatory)
| Start simple, add caching if API performance degrades during rollout
| Potential cache staleness if implemented (acceptable trade-off for performance)
