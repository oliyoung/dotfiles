== Problem Statement

[TODO: This section explains WHY we're building this solution. It should articulate the problem we're solving in outcome-focused terms, not just "absence of something" (e.g., not "we don't have an API" but "teams can't access authoritative data, causing manual reconciliation").

Follow the structure:
1. Current State Pain Points - What's broken? What friction exists?
2. Business Impact - Quantified cost/risk (revenue, support costs, customer satisfaction, operational overhead)
3. Root Cause Analysis - WHY is this happening? Use 5 Whys technique
4. Why Now? - What's changed? Why is this urgent?
5. Alternatives Considered - Shows you explored the problem space]

=== Current State Pain Points

[TODO: Describe the specific pain points in the current state. Use bullet points for clarity.

Examples:
* *Manual Process:* Teams manually perform X, creating operational overhead and delay
* *Data Lag:* Information takes Y days to update, causing customer confusion
* *No Single Source of Truth:* Data exists in multiple places, requiring dual maintenance
* *Error-Prone:* Manual process increases risk of discrepancies
* *Limited Scalability:* Current approach doesn't scale to [future need]

Focus on observable problems, not missing features. "Store managers spend 2 hours/week on manual updates" not "We don't have automation".]

=== Business Impact

[TODO: Quantify the business impact of these pain points. Connect problems to business metrics:

* *Customer Satisfaction:* [How does this affect customer experience? NPS impact?]
* *Support Costs:* [How many support tickets? What's the cost?]
* *Revenue Risk:* [Revenue at risk? Lost opportunities?]
* *Operational Overhead:* [Time spent? FTE cost?]
* *Partnership Risk:* [SLA breaches? Contract penalties?]
* *Compliance Risk:* [Regulatory exposure?]

Use specific numbers when possible: "$42K annually", "89 support tickets/month", "18% of users dissatisfied"]

=== Root Cause Analysis

[TODO: Explain WHY this problem exists. Use the 5 Whys technique to get to the true root cause.

Example structure:
"The current [process/system] was designed for [original context] (legacy architecture from [timeframe]). [Partner/System] has since [evolved/changed], but [OTRG system] still operates on the original [approach].

The underlying causes:
* [Historical context explaining original design]
* [What's changed since then]
* [Technical/organizational constraint preventing evolution]
* [Missing capability or misalignment]

This is **not** a case of 'we don't have [output]' (that's the output we'll build). The root cause is that **[outcome-focused explanation of what teams/customers can't do and why]**, resulting in [specific business impact]."

The bold statement at the end should articulate the outcome, not the output.]

=== Why Now?

[TODO: Explain the urgency. What's changed that makes this a priority NOW?

Examples:
* *Partner Platform Ready:* [Partner] now supports [capability] that wasn't available before
* *SLA Requirements:* Contract requires [specific SLA] by [date]
* *Expansion Requirement:* [Initiative X] requires this capability to proceed
* *Customer Experience Priority:* Improving [metric] from X to Y significantly impacts [business goal]
* *Operational Efficiency:* Current manual process no longer scales to [volume/scope]
* *Competitive Pressure:* Market expects [capability]; we're behind
* *Regulatory Requirement:* Compliance deadline of [date]]

=== Alternatives Considered

[TODO: Show that you explored the problem space and considered multiple solutions. Use a table:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Alternative | Pros | Cons / Why Not Selected

| *[Alternative 1 - e.g., Maintain current process]*
| [Benefits - e.g., No change required; existing process stable]
| [Why rejected - e.g., Doesn't solve customer experience issue; SLA breach risk continues]

| *[Alternative 2 - e.g., Real-time solution]*
| [Benefits - e.g., Immediate updates; no batch delay]
| [Why rejected - e.g., Significantly more complex; business requirements don't justify real-time]

| *[Alternative 3 - e.g., Custom build]*
| [Benefits - e.g., Custom optimisation possible]
| [Why rejected - e.g., Duplicates effort; operational complexity; misses reuse opportunity]

| *Selected: [Your chosen approach]*
| [Why chosen - benefits that outweigh trade-offs]
| [Trade-offs accepted - what you're giving up]
|===

This demonstrates architectural thinking and trade-off analysis.]

== What We're Building

[TODO: NOW describe the solution (the output) - what technical implementation delivers the outcomes articulated in the Problem Statement above.

Brief 1-2 paragraph description of what this initiative delivers. Focus on the business capability and customer/operational value, not just technical implementation.

The reader should understand how this solution addresses the pain points, business impact, and root causes documented above.]
